## Did you code mostly in classes, internships, real jobs, or personal projects? Put example projects and what did you do.

I have mostly worked on projects for classes, but also have done many personal projects. As a game dev/design concentration student, most of my projects have been games. I have my game portfolio posted on my itch [here](https://cam-com.itch.io/) and you can view my public Github repositories to see the projects' code. 

For the past 2 summers, I have worked as a technical customer support agent with a children's summer camp program running intro programming courses. I also work as a tutor on campus through the Learning Center, and I tutor CS 120, 121, 124, 222, 224, 230, and 315. I have a lot of experience with helping others with their projects, at all skill levels.

Last semester, I also took CS 499 (independent study project) with Dr. G, where I worked with a local board game developer as my client. I took one of his board game designs and converted to a digital version on Board Game Arena, and also gave a tech talk presentation about my work. This game is now fully published on the website publicly for anyone to play, and my client is extremely happy about it.

## What was the largest program/system youâ€™ve worked on?
The largest project I've worked on was my CS 390 (Game Studio Pre-Production) final project. This was an 8-week long vertical slice of the game that we are now making in CS 414/415 (the game development concentration version of this 495 course). I wrote nearly all the code for this project. I used Unity (C#) and made a vertical slice about a 3D management game where you are a Duck managing a hotel of other ducks. You can find this game and code under the name Duck Duck Hotel on my Itch and Github.

## What do you feel most comfortable doing in code?
I most enjoy making large-scale systems that work together, such as state machines, grid classes, and time handlers. You can find examples of these in Duck Duck Hotel. Overall, I would say I am quite comfortable with anything relating to code, given a day or two to learn new specific things relating to the language if I am unfamiliar with it.

## What do you feel least comfortable doing?
In game development, we very rarely work in TDD, so I am not as comfortable with that style of writing code (if that is what we are doing in this class). I am also very comfortable in OOO styles/languages, so outside of that I would be less comfortable.
